Reprap_KTY-84-130 - support files for using the KTY 84-130 temperature sensor with reprap 3d printer

The KTY 84-130 temperature sensor is a temperature sensor rated up to 300 Â° C which I wanted to use as a replacement for the standard 100k thermistors used in repraps.

The resistance values are taken from the datasheet and the thermistor table created a python skript, which I will add once I have cleaned it up a little bit.



Usage:

- copy ThermistorTable.h into your firmware build directory
- edit config.h for your firmware to use the thermistor table


Tested with the following firmwares:

- Teacup
