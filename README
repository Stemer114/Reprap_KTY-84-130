Reprap_KTY-84-130 - support files for using the KTY 84-130 temperature sensor
with reprap 3d printer

The KTY 84-130 is a silicon temperature sensor rated for -40..300Â°C which I use as 
a replacement for the standard 100k thermistors used in repraps.

The KTY was more readily available for me than the standard 100k reprap
thermistors. At the german distributor reichelt, where I ordered most of my
electronic components the 100k thermistor is not available, but the KTY 84-130
is and is only about 0.77 EUR per piece.

The housing is a SOD68 leaded package with a diameter of 1.6mm which can easily
be incorporated into the hotend.

This work is based on a python script from
http://diyhpl.us/reprap/trunk/users/wizard23/python/lookupTables/KTY84-130.py

adapted by Stemer114 for usage with 4.7k pull-up resistor
and table format for teacup firmware

usage: 
  python KTY84-130.py >ThermistorTable.h
  copy ThermistorTable.h into your firmware dir
  enable the lookup table in firmware config.h (depends on firmware)

The setup right now is the KTY 84-130 connected instead of the 100k Thermistor,
ie. the sensor connected between the port pin and ground. Additionally, on the
Sanguinololu 1.3a controller board I use, there is a 4.7k pull-up connected to
the port pin (which is accounted for in calculating the table values).

So far, I have tested the hotend only without filament. The temperature is
reached and held accordingly without apparent problems.
