usage for repetier firmware: 
  run python KTY84-130_repetier.py

open repetier firmware Configuration.h in an editor and locate the user 
thermistor table 1 definition (row 418):

/** Number of entries in the user thermistortable 1. Set to 0 to disable it. */
#define NUM_TEMPS_USERTHERMISTOR1 0
#define USER_THERMISTORTABLE1  {}  

comment these two defines out and insert the output from the python script instead.

now you only need to enable the user thermistor table for your sensors.

for the extruder hotend, locate appropriate define (here row 180)

#define EXT0_TEMPSENSOR_TYPE 1

and change it to 51

for the heated bed, locate appropriate define (here row 553)

#define HEATED_BED_SENSOR_TYPE 0

and change it to 51 as well.

  copy ThermistorTable.h into your firmware dir
  enable the lookup table in firmware config.h (depends on firmware)

The setup right now is the KTY 84-130 connected instead of the 100k Thermistor,
ie. the sensor connected between the port pin and ground. Additionally, on the
Sanguinololu 1.3a controller board I use, there is a 4.7k pull-up connected to
the port pin (which is accounted for in calculating the table values).

I have been running a self-built hotend with the KTY 84-130 for a couple of 
weeks now without any problems. I have printed almost all parts for a Mendel90
which will be my second printer after the Wolfstrap based repstrap.
